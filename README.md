#  USearch Molecules

This is a major refactor of the repo [usearch-molecules](https://github.com/ashvardanian/usearch-molecules). A lot of 
the functionality remains similar with a more streamlined experience for creating new datasets and searching new datasets. 

There still needs to be a lot of testing done and I want to make sure that this is compatible with pre-indexed and calculated 
datasets that are presented in the original repository. 

I will update this readme once I have all the testing done.
